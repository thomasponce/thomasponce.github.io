Today I will be talking about how to install and use an Ansible Playbook. So basically what an ansible playbook is a script of instructions that you can run to do a desired task.
In order to download ansible you can run the command *apt install ansible*. From there, you do not have to worry about set up or configuration and you can get straight to work. 
Playbooks are written in YAML or *Yet Another Markup Language*. So the extension for your file is *.yml*. 

In order to start writing the playbook you can use any text editior to get started.
Once you are in your text editor you need to start the file with ---. This allows the program to make the distinction and can start the playbook. 

You are given the option the name certain sequences or the entire document. To do this, you simple type *name:* followed by whatever you'd like. 

Next you must announce the host. You are able to do this locally, on a server, or multiple machines. You must define this and set up any servers or users in advance. 

After writing this at the top you can get to writing the script and what you would like done. Your script will mainly shape around tasks so that is what you will write in. 
You can write these tasks in a list. You are also able to set varible that will be used in your playbook. 
One thing you should note is that you must watch your spacing/indents when writing the script. Many errors can easily be solved with spacing and indenting.
This is why naming certain sections can be great because it can help tell you what sections need debugging. 

In order to run the playbook you will write the command: *anisible-playbook filename*. It will run the steps and give you feedback of each section in the output.

This is the basics of creating an Ansible Playbook. Using this, it can be a helpful tool espically when sharing with other users or groups!
